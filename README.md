# Spotify Data Analysis
In todayâ€™s digital music era, streaming platforms like Spotify generate massive amounts of listening data.
But how do we understand what people listen to, when they listen, and which albums, artists, or tracks stand out the most?

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze Spotify albums data and build an interactive dashboard that answers key business questions such as:

### How do listening trends change over time?
What are the most popular albums, artists, and tracks?
Do listening patterns differ on weekdays vs weekends?
How does the latest yearâ€™s engagement compare with the previous year?

## Steps in the Project
Requirement Gathering â€“ Identified business questions for Albums, Artists, Tracks & Listening patterns.
Data Preparation â€“ Imported raw data, removed duplicates, handled missing values.
Data Modeling â€“ Built relationships between Albums, Artists & Tracks.
Data Processing â€“ Applied Power Query transformations and Excel checks.
DAX Calculations â€“ Created measures for YoY growth, LY vs PY trends, Top N.
Dashboard Design â€“ Structured visuals for intuitive storytelling.
Report Development â€“ Built interactive dashboards in Power BI with drill-down, drill-through, and grid view.
